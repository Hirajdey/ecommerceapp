import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

/*export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
âœ… What's happening here?
store.getState() is a function that returns the entire Redux state object.

typeof store.getState gives you the type of that function.

ReturnType<typeof store.getState> extracts the return type of that function, which is your complete state shape.

So, RootState becomes the type that represents your Redux state tree.

If your store looks like this :

reducer: {
  counter: counterReducer,
  products: productsReducer
}

Then RootState types will look like this :

type RootState = {
  counter: CounterState;
  products: ProductsState;
}

and then we can use ti like this : 

const count = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.counter.value)

This helps you get autocomplete, type checking, and avoids bugs!*/
